# AI-First Fine-Tuning for O3 Agentic Coding Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines the AI-First approach to fine-tuning Codestral-22B for optimized agentic coding performance. The process leverages lightweight LoRA adaptation to enhance tool use, instruction following, and context expansion capabilities specifically for O3 agentic workflows.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dataset Curation by AI
**Instead of manual data collection, use AI to generate contextually relevant examples:**
- Start with high-level task descriptions (e.g., "implement code analysis tool")
- Allow base model to generate multi-step solutions with tool integration
- Focus on quality over quantity (small dataset, high relevance)

### 2. Minimal Intervention Fine-Tuning
**LoRA approach minimizes resource requirements:**
- Train on RTX A6000 multi-GPU setup (4x 48GB)
- Use 4-bit quantization to fit 22B model
- Target specific layers for agentic adaptation (attention + MLP)

### 3. O3-Specific Optimizations
**Fine-tune specifically for extended context and tool chaining:**
- 256K+ context window optimization
- Tool call reasoning and chaining
- Code complexity analysis and refactoring patterns

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install torch transformers accelerate peft datasets
```

### Step 2: Dataset Generation
The training dataset is AI-generated in-context examples featuring:
- **Code Analysis Tasks**: Complexity metrics, AST parsing
- **Tool Integration**: File watching, automated analysis
- **Agentic Patterns**: Multi-step reasoning with tool use

See `scripts/lora_finetune_codestral.py::create_agentic_dataset()` for implementation.

### Step 3: LoRA Configuration
```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,  # Low-rank adaptation dimension
    target_modules=[
        "q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",  # Attention layers
        "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"      # MLP layers
    ],
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)
```
**Intuition**: Adapt attention and feed-forward components where agentic reasoning occurs.

### Step 4: Training Optimization
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=16,  # Effective batch size = 16
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    num_train_epochs=2,  # Minimal epochs for convergence
    lr_scheduler_type="constant"  # Steady learning rate
)
```

**AI-First Consideration**: Use minimal training steps (2 epochs) to capture essential patterns without over-fitting.

### Step 5: Multi-GPU Utilization
Automatic device mapping for RTX A6000 setup:
- Pipeline parallelism across 4 GPUs (45-48GB each)
- Quantized model fits within VRAM constraints
- Gradient accumulation for effective batch processing

## Performance Expectations

### Before Fine-Tuning (Base Codestral-22B)
- Tool use: Basic function calling
- Context: Standard 32K window
- Agentic: Reactive responses

### After O3 Fine-Tuning
- Tool use: Advanced chaining and reasoning
- Context: Optimized for 256K+ O3 expansion
- Agentic: Proactive code analysis and refactoring suggestions

### Training Metrics Target
- Memory usage: <60GB per GPU
- Training time: <2 hours on 4x RTX A6000
- LoRA parameters: ~0.2% of total model parameters
- Convergence: Within 2 epochs

## Validation and Deployment

### Step 6: Post-Training Validation
Test fine-tuned model on:
1. Code complexity analysis tasks
2. Multi-tool chaining scenarios
3. Long-context agentic workflows

### Step 7: Ollama Integration
Create custom model for production:
```bash
# After training, update Modelfile to load adapter
ollama create codestral-o3 -f Modelfile
```

### Step 8: O3 Optimization Integration
- Use fine-tuned model in O3 multi-GPU tests
- Monitor context expansion performance
- Validate agentic coding improvements

## Why AI-First Approach?

1. **Efficiency**: AI generates training data faster than manual curation
2. **Relevance**: Context-aware examples match real-world O3 use cases
3. **Scalability**: Process can be automated for future model versions
4. **Quality**: AI understands complex agentic patterns better than humans can enumerate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size or increase gradient accumulation
- **Poor Convergence**: Check dataset quality and learning rate
- **Model Corruption**: Ensure consistent quantization across training

### Hardware Optimization Tips
- Use NVLink for inter-GPU communication (if available)
- Monitor VRAM usage with `nvidia-smi`
- Adjust model parallelism based on GPU interconnect

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expanded Dataset**: Collect real O3 interaction logs for continuous improvement
2. **Hierarchical Fine-Tuning**: Multi-stage adaptation (general → coding → agentic)
3. **Quantization Aware**: Train with 8-bit or 4-bit end-to-end
4. **Multitask Learning**: Combine coding, analysis, and tool use objectives
