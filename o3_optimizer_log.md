# O3 Optimization Implementation Log

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ACTIVE - High-Context Hardware Optimization Updates

## ðŸ”„ Configuration Updates - High Context Focus

### Changes Made to `o3_ai_config.yaml`

#### 1. **Binary Search Optimization**
- **Updated:** `initial_context_probe: 65536` (64k tokens) for HP Strix capacity
- **Rationale:** Start at mid-range for high-capacity systems vs previous 16k
- **Impact:** Faster convergence on extreme contexts (32k/64k/128k+ range)
- **Log:** Binary search factor reduced to 1.3 (more conservative for stability)

#### 2. **Adaptive Batch Scaling Enhancement**
- **Updated:** Initial batches increased (16-64 for large/small models)
- **Scaling Factor:** Changed to 2.0x (from 1.5x) for aggressive expansion
- **Rationale:** Leverage HP Strix 64GB+ capacity for maximum throughput
- **Impact:** 4x higher batch sizes possible (up to 256 max_batch)

#### 3. **Resource Management Shift**
- **VRAM Reserve:** Increased to 4GB (from 2GB) for stability margins
- **RAM Reserve:** Increased to 4GB for system stability
- **Scaling Factor:** Removed safety margin (1.0 instead of 1.1)
- **Rationale:** HP Strix workstations can handle capacity push without safety nets

#### 4. **Hardware-Specific Thresholds**
- **Max VRAM:** 90% utilization (aggressive for capacity exploitation)
- **Max RAM:** 85% utilization (conservative for system stability)
- **Temperature:** 85Â°C threshold for AMD GPUs
- **CPU:** 90% monitoring for multi-threaded workloads

## ðŸ“‹ Plan Updates - `O3_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`

### Executive Summary Update
- **Status:** Active - High-Context Hardware Optimization (32k/64k/128k+ tokens)
- **Hardware Target:** Explicitly HP Strix Halo workstations (AMD GPUs, 64GB+ VRAM/RAM)
- **Focus Shift:** From "balanced performance" to "capacity exploitation"

### Optimization Shift Table Added
