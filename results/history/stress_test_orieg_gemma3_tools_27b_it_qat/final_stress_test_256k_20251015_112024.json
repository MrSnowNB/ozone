Data Models**\n\nThe application centers around three core models: `User`, `Company`, and `Project`.\n\n*   **User:**  Extends Django's built-in `AbstractUser` model, providing standard user authentication fields (username, password, email, first\\_name, last\\_name) along with custom fields:\n    *   `uuid`:  A unique identifier for each user, useful for internal tracking and potentially integration with external systems.  Using UUIDs avoids potential ID collisions.\n    *   `phone`:  Optional phone number for user contact.\n    *   `company`:  A `ForeignKey` relationship to the `Company` model, indicating the company the user belongs to.  Allows for multi-tenancy or organization of users.  `on_delete=models.CASCADE` means deleting a company will also delete associated users.\n    *   `role`:  A `CharField` with predefined choices (`admin`, `manager`, `developer`, `user`) to define user permissions and access levels.\n    *   `is_active`:  A boolean flag to enable/disable user accounts.\n    *   `created_at`, `updated_at`:  Timestamps for tracking creation and modification times.\n    *   `Meta`:  Ordering by creation time (`-created_at`) for easy retrieval of recent users.\n\n*   **Company:** Represents a company or organization using the application.\n    *   `name`:  Unique company name.\n    *   `domain`:  Unique domain associated with the company.\n    *   `description`:  Optional company description.\n    *   `subscription_plan`:  A `CharField` with choices (`free`, `basic`, `premium`, `enterprise`) to define the company's subscription level and associated features.\n    *   `max_users`:  The maximum number of users allowed for the company based on their subscription plan.\n    *   `created_at`:  Timestamp for tracking creation time.\n\n*   **Project:** Represents a project associated with a company and managed by a user.\n    *   `title`:  Project title.\n    *   `description`:  Optional project description.\n    *   `company`:  A `ForeignKey` relationship to",

It covers load balancing, database clustering, caching, CDN integration, background job processing, monitoring, logging, and disaster recovery.  We'll assume a cloud-based deployment (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for flexibility and scalability.  The specific services used will be examples; equivalent services exist on other platforms.\n\n**I. Architecture Overview**\n\nThe architecture will be a multi-tiered system, separating concerns and enabling independent scaling.\n\n*   **Web Tier:**  Handles user requests, runs the Django application.\n*   **Application Tier:**  Contains the core business logic, potentially separated into microservices for complex applications.  (We'll assume a monolithic application for this design, but highlight where microservices would be beneficial).\n*   **Database Tier:** Stores application data.  Clustered for high availability and scalability.\n*   **Cache Tier:**  Reduces database load and improves response times.\n*   **Background Job Queue:** Handles asynchronous tasks.\n*   **CDN:**  Delivers static assets quickly.\n\n**II. Detailed Infrastructure Components**\n\n**1. Web Tier (Load Balancing & Application Servers)**\n\n*   **Load Balancer:**  AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Google Cloud Load Balancing.  Distributes traffic across multiple application servers.  Health checks ensure only healthy servers receive traffic.  We'll use a combination of Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and Network Load Balancer (NLB) if there are specific TCP/UDP requirements.\n*   **Application Servers:**  EC2 instances (AWS), Compute Engine instances (Google Cloud), or Virtual Machines (Azure).  These instances will run the Django application using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.\n*   **Auto Scaling:**  Configure Auto Scaling groups to automatically scale the number of application servers based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or request queue length.  This ensures the application can handle fluctuating traffic.  Minimum and maximum instance counts should be defined.\n*   **Containerization (Recommended):**  Dockerize the Django application for consistent deployments and easier scaling.  Use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) to manage the containers.\n*   **Number",
