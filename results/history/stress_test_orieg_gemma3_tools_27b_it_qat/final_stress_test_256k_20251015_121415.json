Data Models**\n\nThe application centers around three core models: `User`, `Company`, and `Project`.  Let's break down each one:\n\n*   **User:** This model extends Django's built-in `AbstractUser` model, providing standard user authentication fields (username, password, email, first\\_name, last\\_name) along with custom fields:\n    *   `uuid`: A unique identifier for each user, useful for internal tracking and potentially integration with other systems.  Using UUIDs avoids potential ID collisions.\n    *   `phone`:  A phone number associated with the user.  `blank=True` allows for optional phone numbers.\n    *   `company`: A `ForeignKey` relationship to the `Company` model, indicating which company the user belongs to.  `on_delete=models.CASCADE` means deleting a company will also delete associated users. `null=True, blank=True` allows users to exist without being associated with a company.\n    *   `role`: A `CharField` with predefined choices (admin, manager, developer, user) defining the user's permissions within the application.  This is a crucial field for authorization.\n    *   `is_active`: A boolean field indicating whether the user account is active.  This is standard practice for user account management.\n    *   `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking creation and modification times.\n    *   `Meta`: Ordering by creation date in descending order, making it easy to retrieve the most recently created users.\n\n*   **Company:** This model represents a company using the application.\n    *   `name`: The company's name, enforced to be unique.\n    *   `domain`: The company's domain name, also enforced to be unique.  This could be used for verification or branding.\n    *   `description`: A text field for a company description.\n    *   `subscription_plan`: A `CharField` with predefined choices (free, basic, premium, enterprise) defining the company's subscription level.  This likely drives feature access and resource limits.\n    *   `max_users`: A `PositiveIntegerField` defining the maximum number of users allowed for the company'",

Authentication API (using Token Authentication)**\n\nWe'll use Token Authentication for simplicity and ease of implementation.

If `company_name` is provided, it creates a new company and associates the user with it.  Validation includes username uniqueness, email format, password strength, and phone number format.\n*   **`/auth/login/` (POST):**\n    *   Request Body: `{\"username\", \"password\"}`\n    *   Response: 200 OK (with token) or 400 Bad Request (invalid credentials)\n    *   Logic: Authenticates user and returns a token.\n*   **`/auth/logout/` (POST):**\n    *   Request Body: `{\"token\"}` (token from Authorization header)\n    *   Response: 200 OK or 400 Bad Request (invalid token)\n    *   Logic: Invalidates the token.\n*   **`/auth/user/` (GET):**\n    *   Requires Authentication.\n    *   Response: 200 OK (with user details, excluding password)\n    *   Logic: Returns the details of the currently authenticated user.\n*   **`/auth/user/update/` (PUT/PATCH):**\n    *   Requires Authentication.\n    *   Request Body: `{\"phone\", \"email\", \"password\"}` (password optional for update)\n    *   Response: 200 OK (with updated user details) or 400 Bad Request (validation errors)\n    *   Logic: Updates the currently authenticated user's information.\n\n**II.

It covers load balancing, database clustering, caching, CDN integration, background jobs, monitoring, logging, and disaster recovery.  The design prioritizes high availability, scalability, and maintainability.\n\n**I. Overall Architecture**\n\nThe architecture will be a multi-tiered, distributed system leveraging cloud services (AWS is used as an example, but similar services exist on other platforms like Azure and GCP).  The tiers are:\n\n*   **Presentation Tier (Web Servers):** Handles user requests and serves static content.\n*   **Application Tier (Django Servers):** Executes the Django application logic.\n*   **Data Tier (Database Cluster):** Stores and manages application data.\n*   **Cache Tier (Redis Cluster):**  Stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.\n*   **Background Job Queue (Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis):** Handles asynchronous tasks.\n\n**II. Detailed Component Breakdown**\n\n**1. Presentation Tier (Web Servers)**\n\n*   **Technology:** Nginx or Apache.  Nginx is preferred for its performance and efficiency.\n*   **Scaling:** Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 instances.  Scaling triggered by CPU utilization, memory usage, and request latency.\n*   **Load Balancing:** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) \u2013 Application Load Balancer (ALB) \u2013 distributes traffic across the web server instances.  Health checks ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.\n*   **Static Content:** Served directly by the web servers or, preferably, a CDN (see section 6).\n*   **Security:**  SSL/TLS termination at the ELB.  Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.\n\n**2. Application Tier (Django Servers)**\n\n*   **Technology:** Gunicorn or uWSGI as WSGI servers.  Gunicorn is simpler to configure and manage.\n*   **Scaling:** Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 instances. Scaling triggered by CPU utilization, memory usage, and queue length (if using Celery).\n*   **Load Balancing:**  ALB distributes traffic across the Django server instances.
