Data Models (models.py)**\n\nThe application centers around three core models: `User`, `Company`, and `Project`.\n\n*   **User:** Extends Django's built-in `AbstractUser` model, providing standard user authentication fields (username, password, email, first\\_name, last\\_name) along with custom fields:\n    *   `uuid`: A unique identifier for each user, useful for internal tracking and potentially integration with other systems.  Using UUIDs is a good practice for avoiding collisions, especially in distributed systems.\n    *   `phone`:  A phone number associated with the user.  The `blank=True` allows for optional phone numbers.\n    *   `company`: A `ForeignKey` relationship to the `Company` model, indicating the company the user belongs to.  `on_delete=models.CASCADE` means deleting a company will also delete associated users. `null=True, blank=True` allows users to exist without being associated with a company.\n    *   `role`: A `CharField` with predefined choices (admin, manager, developer, user). This field is crucial for authorization and access control.\n    *   `is_active`: A boolean field to enable/disable user accounts.\n    *   `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking creation and modification times.\n    *   `Meta`: Defines ordering by creation date in descending order, which is a sensible default for displaying recent activity.\n\n*   **Company:** Represents a company using the application.\n    *   `name`: Unique company name.  The `unique=True` constraint ensures no two companies have the same name.\n    *   `domain`: Unique domain name.  `unique=True` constraint ensures no two companies have the same domain.\n    *   `description`: A text field for company details.\n    *   `subscription_plan`: A `CharField` with predefined choices (free, basic, premium, enterprise). This field likely drives feature access and resource limits.\n    *   `max_users`: An integer field defining the maximum number of users allowed for this company's subscription plan.\n    *   `created_at`: Timestamp for tracking creation time.\n\n*   **",

Supports pagination.\n    *   **Response**: 200 OK - `[{\"id\", \"name\", \"domain\", \"description\", \"subscription_plan\", \"max_users\", \"created_at\"}, ...]`\n*   **`POST /companies/`**: Create a new company.\n    *   **Request Body**: `{\"name\", \"domain\", \"description\", \"subscription_plan\", \"max_users\"}`\n    *   **Response**: 201 Created - Company details. 400 Bad Request - Validation errors.\n*   **`GET /companies/{company_id}/`**: Retrieve a specific company.\n    *   **Response**: 200 OK - Company details. 404 Not Found -",

It covers load balancing, database clustering, caching, CDN integration, background job processing, monitoring, logging, and disaster recovery.  The design prioritizes high availability, scalability, and maintainability.\n\n**I. Overall Architecture**\n\nThe architecture will be a multi-tiered, distributed system leveraging cloud services (AWS is used as an example, but similar services exist on other platforms like Azure and GCP).  The tiers are:\n\n*   **Presentation Tier (Web Servers):** Handles user requests and serves static content.\n*   **Application Tier (Django Servers):** Executes the Django application logic.\n*   **Data Tier (Database Cluster):** Stores and manages application data.\n*   **Cache Tier (Redis Cluster):** Stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.\n*   **Message Queue (Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis):** Handles asynchronous tasks.\n*   **CDN:** Delivers static assets globally.\n\n**II. Detailed Component Breakdown**\n\n**1. Presentation Tier (Web Servers)**\n\n*   **Technology:** Nginx or Apache.  Nginx is preferred for its performance and efficiency.\n*   **Scaling:** Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 instances.  Scaling triggered by CPU utilization, memory usage, and request latency.\n*   **Load Balancing:** Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) \u2013 Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic across the web server instances.  Health checks ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.\n*   **Static Content:** Served directly by Nginx, reducing load on the Django application servers.\n*   **Security:**  SSL/TLS termination handled by ELB.  Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.\n\n**2. Application Tier (Django Servers)**\n\n*   **Technology:** Gunicorn or uWSGI as WSGI servers. Gunicorn is simpler to configure and manage.\n*   **Scaling:** Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 instances. Scaling triggered by CPU utilization, memory usage, and request queue length.\n*   **Load Balancing:** ALB distributes traffic across the Django application servers.\n*   **Deployment:** Continuous Integration/",
