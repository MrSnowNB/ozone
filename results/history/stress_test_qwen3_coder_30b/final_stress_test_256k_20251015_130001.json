OVERVIEW\n\nThis Django application represents a comprehensive project management and user management system with multi-tenancy capabilities. The architecture demonstrates a well-structured approach to handling user roles, company management, and project tracking within a scalable Django framework.\n\n## 2. DATA MODELS ANALYSIS\n\n### 2.1 User Model (Custom AbstractUser)\nThe User model extends Django's built-in AbstractUser, providing a robust foundation for user management while maintaining compatibility with Django's authentication system. Key features include:\n\n- **UUID Primary Key**: Uses UUID as primary key for enhanced security and to prevent enumeration attacks\n- **Role-based Access Control**: Implements role-based permissions with choices for admin, manager, developer, and user roles\n- **Company Association**: Links users to companies through a ForeignKey relationship, enabling multi-tenancy\n- **Phone Number Field**: Additional contact information field for user profiles\n- **Active Status Tracking**: Boolean field to manage user account activation status\n- **Timestamps**: Automatic creation and update timestamps for audit trails\n\n### 2.2 Company Model\nThe Company model serves as the core tenant entity in this multi-tenancy architecture:\n\n- **Unique Constraints**: Enforces unique company names and domains to prevent duplicates\n- **Subscription Management**: Implements tiered subscription plans with four levels (free, basic, premium, enterprise)\n- **User Limitation**: Tracks maximum users allowed per company subscription\n- **Description Field**: Provides space for company information\n- **Timestamps**: Maintains creation timestamp for company records\n\n### 2.3 Project Model\nThe Project model represents the central business entity for project management:\n\n- **Comprehensive Status Tracking**: Five project status options (planning, active, on_hold, completed, cancelled)\n- **Priority Management**: Four priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent) for project prioritization\n- **Timeline Management**: Date fields for start and end dates with nullable options\n- **Budget Tracking**: Decimal field for project budget management\n- **Manager Assignment**: Links projects to specific managers through ForeignKey relationship\n- **Company Association**: Projects are tied to companies, maintaining multi-tenancy structure\n- **Timestamps**: Creation and update timestamps for project tracking\n\n## 3. BUSINESS LOGIC FLOWS\n\n### 3.1 User Management Flow\nThe application implements a clear user management workflow:\n\n1. **User Registration**: New users are created with default 'user'",

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SUMMARY\n\nThe Django application architecture includes core models for User, Company, and Project with relationships between them. The codebase shows a typical multi-tenant structure where users belong to companies and projects are associated with companies and managers. Key performance concerns include potential N+1 query issues in views, missing database indexes, inefficient data access patterns, and lack of caching strategies.\n\n# 2. DETAILED ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n## 2.1 N+1 Query Problems\n\n### 2.1.1 Project List View\nIn views.py, when listing projects, there's likely an N+1 query issue when accessing project manager's name or company name without proper prefetching.\n\n**Issue**: \n```python\n# views.py - ProjectListView\nprojects = Project.objects.all()\nfor project in projects:\n    print(project.manager.username)  # N+1 query\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: \nUse `select_related()` to fetch manager data in single query:\n```python\nprojects = Project.objects.select_related('manager', 'company').all()\n```\n\n### 2.1.2 User List View\nWhen displaying user list with company information, similar N+1 issues may occur.\n\n**Issue**: \n```python\n# views.py - UserListView\nusers = User.objects.all()\nfor user in users:\n    print(user.company.name)  # N+1 query\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: \n```python\nusers = User.objects.select_related('company').all()\n```\n\n## 2.2 Missing Database Indexes\n\n### 2.2.1 User Model\nThe User model lacks indexes on frequently queried fields.\n\n**Issue**: \n- `username` field (not indexed by default)\n- `company` foreign key (missing index)\n- `role` field (frequently filtered)\n\n**Recommendation**: \n```python\nclass User(AbstractUser):\n    # ... existing fields ...\n    company = models.ForeignKey('Company', on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True, db_index=True)\n    role = models.CharField(max_length=50,",

OVERVIEW\n\nThe Django project implements a multi-tenant application with user roles and company-based access control. The architecture includes custom User model extending AbstractUser, Company model for multi-tenancy, and Project model for project management. The system supports role-based access control with different user roles (admin, manager, developer, user) and company subscription plans.\n\n# 2. USER MODEL ANALYSIS\n\nThe User model extends Django's AbstractUser, which is a good approach for customizing user functionality while maintaining Django's built-in authentication features. Key aspects:\n\n- UUID field for unique identification\n- Phone number field for contact information\n- Company foreign key relationship for multi-tenancy\n- Role-based access control with predefined choices\n- Active status tracking\n- Timestamps for creation and updates\n\nThe model design is solid but has some areas for improvement:\n- Missing email field (required for Django's default auth)\n- No password reset functionality implemented\n- Limited user profile information\n- Role field is not properly enforced at database level\n\n# 3. COMPANY MULTI-TENANCY\n\nThe Company model serves as the multi-tenancy foundation:\n- Unique company name and domain\n- Subscription plan with tiered access\n- User limits per company\n- Timestamps for tracking\n\nThe implementation is basic but functional:\n- Company relationship in User model\n- Company relationship in Project model\n- No explicit tenant isolation in queries\n\n# 4. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM\n\nThe system uses Django's built-in authentication but lacks comprehensive authorization implementation:\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) defined in User model\n- No custom permission system\n- No explicit authorization checks in views\n- No token-based authentication for API endpoints\n- No session management or CSRF protection beyond Django defaults\n\n# 5. MIDDLEWARE IMPLEMENTATION\n\nMiddleware is not fully implemented in the provided code:\n- No custom middleware for tenant isolation\n- No authentication middleware\n- No security middleware (XSS, CSRF, etc.)\n- No custom middleware for role-based access control\n\n#",

OVERVIEW\n\nThis Django application represents a comprehensive project management and user management system with multi-tenancy capabilities. The architecture demonstrates a well-structured approach to handling user roles, company management, and project tracking within a scalable Django framework.\n\nThe application's core functionality revolves around managing users within companies, tracking projects through various lifecycle stages, and implementing role-based access control. The architecture supports multiple subscription tiers, user roles, and business processes that are typical in enterprise-level project management systems.\n\n## 2. DATA MODELS ANALYSIS\n\n### 2.1 User Model (Custom AbstractUser)\n\nThe User model extends Django's built-in AbstractUser, which is a best practice for customizing user authentication. This approach provides all standard Django user fields while adding custom fields specific to the application's requirements.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- UUID primary key: Provides globally unique identification for users, enhancing security and scalability\n- Phone number field: Supports additional user contact information\n- Company relationship: Establishes one-to-many relationship with Company model\n- Role-based access control: Implements role hierarchy with admin, manager, developer, and user roles\n- Active status tracking: Enables soft deletion and user management\n- Timestamps: Automatic creation and update tracking for audit purposes\n\nThe use of UUID instead of auto-incrementing integers provides several advantages:\n- Security: Prevents enumeration attacks by making user IDs unpredictable\n- Scalability: Allows for distributed systems without ID conflicts\n- Migration compatibility: UUIDs don't require special handling during database migrations\n\n### 2.2 Company Model\n\nThe Company model serves as the foundation for multi-tenancy in this application. It represents organizations that can contain multiple users and projects.\n\nKey features:\n- Unique constraints on name and domain: Ensures company uniqueness and prevents duplicate entries\n- Subscription plans: Supports tiered pricing with free, basic, basic, premium, and enterprise options\n- User limits: Controls maximum number of users per company subscription\n- Business metadata: Includes description field for company information\n\nThe subscription plan implementation allows for business model flexibility and monetization strategies. The max_users field provides resource management capabilities, ensuring that companies cannot exceed their subscription limits.\n\n### 2.3 Project Model\n\nThe Project model represents the core business entity for project management. It includes comprehensive tracking capabilities for project lifecycle management.\n\nKey attributes:\n- Status tracking: Supports five project statuses (planning, active, on_hold, completed, cancelled)\n-",

Infrastructure Overview\n\nThe infrastructure for a Django application supporting 10,000 concurrent users requires a robust, scalable, and highly available architecture. The system will be deployed across multiple availability zones to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance. The architecture will include:\n\n- **Web Servers**: Multiple Django application servers behind a load balancer.\n- **Database**: Master-slave replication with read replicas for handling read-heavy workloads.\n- **Caching**: Redis cluster for session storage, caching, and pub/sub messaging.\n- **Background Jobs**: Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ for task queuing.\n- **Storage**: Cloud storage for static and media files.\n- **Monitoring**: Centralized logging and monitoring with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.\n- **Security**: SSL termination, WAF, and secure communication between components.\n\n### Technologies:\n- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (or Azure/GCP)\n- **Web Server**: Nginx\n- **Application Server**: Gunicorn\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with read replicas)\n- **Caching**: Redis Cluster\n- **Background Jobs**: Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ\n- **Storage**: S3 (or Cloudinary)\n- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK Stack\n- **Load Balancer**: AWS ALB or HAProxy\n- **CDN**: CloudFront (or Fastly)\n\n---\n\n# 2. Load Balancing Strategy\n\n### Load Balancer:\n- **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **HAProxy** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.\n- **Health Checks**: Regular health checks to ensure application servers are responsive.\n- **Auto Scaling**: Integration with Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on load.\n\n### Web Server Configuration:\n- **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to handle static files and forward dynamic requests to Gunicorn.\n- **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server to run Django applications.\n- **Session Handling**: Sticky sessions or shared session storage (Redis)",
